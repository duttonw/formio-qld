## Use native submit action instead of `applicationSubmit` event

With the old Squiz Matrix formio template, `applicationSubmit` event is used extensively to replace the out of the box submit action in submit button.

This is **NOT** recommended anymore with the use of FormioLoader in the Squiz Matrix formio template V2 as the old approach has taken away multiple features from the native submit button,
such as auto scrolling to error message, loading/disabled states of the submit button, multiple clicks prevention on the button, etc.

Custom submit action should be defined in the form controller hook with the `submitDone` event`, ie.

```jsx
({ form }) => {
form.on("submitDone", (e) => {
  // you can see the event object in the browser's inspector.
  console.info("submitDone", e);
  // you can define custom action here after form submission
});
```

Please refer to [here](?path=/docs/helpers-formioloader--docs) for how to use the hook with FormioLoader
and [here](https://www.qld.gov.au/_resources/matrix-documentation/components/form.io-guides/form.io-forms-v2) for how to use the hook in Squiz Matrix formio template.

You could also modify `/src/config/createForm.controller.js` and create PR to add a default custom submit action which will be available globally.
