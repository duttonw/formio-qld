# Why and When

This page provides information about why and when to develop Form.io solution with this library.

## Types of Form.io solutions

To understand why and when to use QG Form.io custom component library for development, we better to understand what is the pros and cons of all the available approaches for developing custom functionality in Form.io.

### Bespoke solution

To extend custom logic on top of the out of the box component, this approach completely rely on the composition of out of the box component and editable properties such as custom JS in calculated value, default value and logic.

### Resource component

https://help.form.io/userguide/resources

> Resources are used to define an object within form.io. This is done by adding Form components to a Resource. Follow the same instructions for Forms when creating Resources. The Form components that are placed onto a Resource determine what the Resource object looks like.
> The original purpose of the Form.io Resource is not for creating reusable components, however, as the Resource is avalable as template in every forms in the same project stage, component developed as Resource could offer certain degree of reusability.

### Custom component

https://help.form.io/developers/custom-components

> One of the more powerful features of the Form.io platform is the ability to create your own custom form components. The process of creating a custom component involves extending a Base class of the component that is "closest" to the implementation you desire, and then override methods or introduce new methods that will implement your custom logic. All of the existing components within the Form.io platform also use this same method, so you can see the multitude of examples by inspecting how the base components for the Form.io renderer are implemented.

Here is the comparison of these approaches:

<table>

    <th>Bespoke solution</th>
    <th>Resource component</th>
    <th>Custom component</th>

  <tr>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fully develop in the Form.io builder, doesn&apos;t require external
          library.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flexible as logic/code introduced could be different from form to
          form.

        </li>
        <li>Resource could be re-use in any forms in the same project stage</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Recommended officially for extending functionality of the out of the
          box components. Modularised, modification takes place in the custom
          library repository, doesn&apos;t require consumers&apos; involvement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encapsulated, complex custom logic is not exposed to the consumers.
        </li>
        <li>Good UX, similar to out of the box component experience.</li>
        <li>
          Good testability , unit testing can be carried out in the repository
          automatically.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Cons</th>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Non-modularised, if modification is required, every single application
          of the solution will need to be modified.
        </li>
        <li> Prone to error if the custom JS logic is complex.</li>
        <li> Easy to introduce error by consumer.</li>
        <li> Develop code in the Form.io editor is difficult.</li>
        <li> Automatic testing on code is not available.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Resource could not be shared across different project or stage, they
          will need to be exported into a template before they can be re-used in
          a different project/stage.
        </li>
        <li>
          The original purpose of Resource is to serve reusable data, using it
          as a custom component provider is not recommended officially.
        </li>
        <li>
          Non-modularised and non-encapsualated, update the logic in the
          original Resource component will not automatic update all usage
          instances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Like the bespoke solution, if modification is required, every single
          application of the Resource component will need to be modified.
        </li>
        <li>Shared the same cons as the bespoke solution.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Consumer will need to request developer to develop such component.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developer required Git and JS programming skills Developer required
          understanding how the components work in the formio.js repository.
        </li>
        <li>
          Required to include the library in the project settings and renderer
          application.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>

## When to develop in QG Form.io custom component library

### Do develop solution in custom component library when:

- You want to develop a solution that expected to be highly reusable.
- If you want to save the solution as a resource component, you better do it as a custom component instead.
- The custom JS in your solution is too complex, bulky, prone to error and needed to be tested properly.
- You need to manipulate an out of the box component in a way that it defeated its own purpose.
- A solution is too complex to be reproduced in another form/project by another consumer.A solution can't be achived with out of the box components.

### Don't develop solution in custom component library when:

- A solution only used in a particular form.
- A solution can be achieved by modifiying out of the box properties, doesn't invove custom JS or only involve simple custom JS.
