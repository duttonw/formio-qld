# Queensland Government Form.io custom component library

## What is QG Form.io custom component library

This library provides bundled JS files to be included in form.io builder / form.io renderer / Squiz Matrix form application and this is the official definition of custom component:

<img src={FormioCustomComponent} alt="share diagram" width="480" />

> One of the more powerful features of the Form.io platform is the ability to create your own custom form components. The process of creating a custom component involves extending a Base class of the component that is "closest" to the implementation you desire, and then override methods or introduce new methods that will implement your custom logic. All of the existing components within the Form.io platform also use this same method, so you can see the multitude of examples by inspecting how the base components for the Form.io renderer are implemented.

The QG Form.io custom component library is based on the official developer guide in https://help.form.io/developers/custom-components and repo https://github.com/formio/contrib.
